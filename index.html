	<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
	<p>My name is Evan Dong and I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with an Information Science and Chinese major. I enjoy organizing and structuing information to make it easy for others to find and use. Additionally, I like to converse with people in Mandarin to practice and improve my linguistic skills. Outside of academics, I enjoy spending free time doing activities with my family or gaming with friends or alone. </p>
